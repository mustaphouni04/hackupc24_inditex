# hackupc24_inditex
The project challenge of INDITEXTECH at HackUPC 2024.
In this project, we have attempted to address the issue of image duplication in datasets. The objective is to detect similar or duplicate images in a dataset with high accuracy, while also minimizing the time and computational power required. To solve this problem, we have divided it into several parts: feature extraction, grouping of features, and identification of clusters. And after looking only inside these clusters if we have similar of same images.
For feature extraction, we have used a pretrained CNN model, ResNet, which was originally trained on the ImageNet dataset. We have decided to use extract features by CNN, because CNN has ability to extract important features from images automatically. We don't have to tell explicitly which features to use, it automatically find which featurers are important. We then fine-tuned it with our dataset, which improved the results in some cases. Although this model is designed primarily for image classification, we have adapted it slightly for feature extraction. The full model contains 11 million parameters. As we aim to minimize computational time, we used only the first few layers of the network, which significantly reduced the number of parameters. After this modification, our model has 683,072 parameters, , demonstrating a substantial reduction.
Once we have extracted our features, we could use another deep learning framework to find similar or duplicate images, or we could even train ResNet to do this as well. However, pursuing this direction presents challenges; initially, we would need a significant amount of data to train our model, followed by extensive computation for training. Moreover, once this model is trained, substantial computational power would be required at inference time due to the large number of parameters. To avoid these issues, we are using CNN solely for feature extraction, and then applying simpler techniques to identify similar or duplicate images.
