# hackupc24_inditex
The project challenge of INDITEXTECH at HackUPC 2024.
In this project, we have attempted to address the issue of image duplication in datasets. The objective is to detect similar or duplicate images in a dataset with high accuracy, while also minimizing the time and computational power required. To solve this problem, we have divided it into several parts: feature extraction, grouping of features, and identification of clusters. And after looking only inside these clusters if we have similar of same images.
For feature extraction we have used CNN pretrained model resnet. It is a model that is pretrained on ImageNet data set
